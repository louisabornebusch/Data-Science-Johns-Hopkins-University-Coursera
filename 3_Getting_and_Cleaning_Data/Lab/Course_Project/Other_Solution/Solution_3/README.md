Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
===============================================================================
The purpose of this project is to collect, and clean a data set provided by 
UCI Machine Learning repository. It is an assignment on the course 
Getting and Cleaning Data by Jeff Leak offered via Coursera. 

The repo is organised in two folders:

	- Raw Data -> 		folder which contains the source (raw) data to be processed.
						The original data set can be found on the following link
						http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
	- Data ->			folder which contains the cleaned (processed) data, produced 
						after running the main script.
	- CodeBook.md		file that describes the variables, the data, and transformations 
						performed to clean up the source data.
	- run_analysis.R	script that processes/transforms the data to get them ready
						for further analysis tasks. The source data of this script is 
						found in the folder Raw_Data, where as the processed data are
						saved in the folder Data.
